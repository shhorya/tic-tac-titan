**The Problem it solves:**

Letâ€™s face it, gaming today can be a bit of a mixed bag. Many players face a common frustration games: are either way too easy or ridiculously hard. On top of that, slow pacing with countless levels and and pointless animations can really drag things out. Many players struggle to kill their boredom without being bombarded by ads at every turn?

Thatâ€™s why I created Tic Tac Titan. I wanted to make a game that cuts through all that clutter. With a simple, clean interface and just the right amount of color, this game keeps things fast-paced and exciting. Plus, players get to choose the difficulty level of the Ultimate AI opponent, letting them pick a challenge that feels just right for them.

No more mindless waiting or annoying distractions; just pure, fun gameplay. So jump in and see if you have what it takes to become the Ultimate Tic Tac Titan!

**Challenges I ran into:**

I am a Beginner, like 2 days ago I was doing printf on C, so this project was very tough for me, but super exciting too! I had to manage my time effectively because I am also preparing for my fresher's performance and handling college assignments. Balancing all these responsibilities made the coding process more challenging.

I faced several challenges while building Tic Tac Titan.

Creating the Game Board: Designing the Tic Tac Toe board was my first hurdle. I had to learn how to represent the board in the console and update it after each turn. I spent time experimenting with different methods to display the board clearly.

Configuring the AI: Implementing a basic AI for the opponent was another significant challenge. Understanding how to create a simple AI that could make strategic moves required me to research various algorithms. I started with a random move generator and gradually improved it to make smarter decisions. Sometimes the AI was too dumb, and other times it was just too powerful, so I had to tune it through trial and error.

Understanding Game Logic: Managing the game's flow and ensuring that the win conditions were correctly implemented was tricky. I had to break down the logic into smaller parts and test each component individually to ensure everything worked as expected.

Debugging: I encountered multiple bugs throughout the development process. When something didn't work, I would isolate the problematic code and use print statements to trace the issue. This trial-and-error approach helped me gain confidence in troubleshooting.

Color Grading: Giving colors to various texts was tough, as many times the unwanted text would get colored. I had to carefully manage the color codes to ensure that only the intended text was affected.

Through persistence and a strong will, I was able to overcome these challenges and create Tic Tac Titan. This project has been super exciting, and I've learned a lot!
